# Course Listing 

All courses listed below are 3 credit hours. 

### DSC 500 Introduction to Data Science 

This course introduces the possibilities, history, and ethics surrounding Data Science. Basics of data science are explored, including vocabulary, programming languages, big data frameworks, visualization, and statistics.  

This course has weekly discussion board posts, responses and quizzes.  There is also a term project that is spread across 4 milestones. 
 
Prior programming experience is not needed for this course. 

### DSC 510 Introduction to Programming 

This course introduces the Python programming language as a tool to clean, slice, and build tools to analyze an existing dataset. Basic principles of programming are explored as well as techniques for configuring a computer for data science work.  

This course has weekly discussion board posts, responses, and a programming exercise.  There is one large programming course due at the end of the course.  This course uses Github and PyCharm primarily. 
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 500 

### DSC 520 Statistics for Data Science 

The R programming language and software environment is commonly used to explore all types of data. Using R, students perform statistical tests on the data. Report writing and presentation of data are introduced.  

This course is students’ first interaction with R and statistics.  Datacamp and RStudio are primarily used in this course.  There are weekly discussions and responses, programming exercises, and a term project that spans the last 3-4 weeks of the course depending on if it is a 10- or 12-week version of the course.   
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 500 

### DSC 530 Data Exploration and Analysis 

This course introduces complex techniques needed for profiling and exploring data. Students use programming and statistics-based inference to ask and answer insightful questions of data.  

This course uses GitHub and Jupyter Notebook primarily.  This course follows the book Think Stats by Allen Downey, using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  In this course, students complete weekly discussion board posts, responses, quizzes, and a weekly programming exercise.  There is a term project due at the end for students to perform EDA on a dataset of their choice. 
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 510 and DSC 520 

### DSC 540 Data Preparation  

Much like life, the data humans produce is infinitely variable in its structure, presentation, and scale. This course prepares students for this infinite variety of data. Students use Python, SQL, and other tools to acquire, prepare, clean, and automate dataset creation.  

This course uses Python (students can choose their IDE) to transform, cleanse and modify data.  Students are exposed to various data sources like CSVs, PDFs, APIs, etc. to pull data and then use various Python libraries to transform the data.  This course has weekly discussion board posts, responses, and programming exercises.  There are two projects required for this course. 
Prerequisite: DSC 510 or equivalent and recommend DSC 530 

### DSC 550 Data Mining 

Data can often contain patterns and anomalies that only emerge at large scale. In this course, students explore techniques to mine and analyze large datasets to discover useful knowledge. Text mining, unstructured data, social networks, and other types of unsupervised data mining methods for data science are included.  

This course uses Python (student can choose their IDE).  Each week there are discussion board posts, responses, quizzes, exercises, and a weekly reflection due.  There is also a term project submitted at the end of the course. This course is organized in two week blocks for the last 4 weeks of the course.   
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 540 

### DSC 630 Predictive Analytics 

This course assembles topics covered in previous courses into an applied project. Students have the opportunity to find, clean, analyze, and report on a project they define. Advanced methods of analysis using Python and R allow students to delve deeper into their projects.  

This course uses both Python and R – with students being allowed to choose what language to do their work in.  Each week there are discussion board posts, responses, exercises, and a status report due.  There is also the opportunity for a group project (although it is an option to work alone) that has 4 milestones and a final presentation due. 
Prerequisite: DSC 540 or equivalent and recommend DSC 550 

### DSC 640 Data Presentation and Visualization  

Data scientists should be great storytellers, whether using visual, text, or other means. In this course, students explore the basic storytelling components of data science and apply them to different types of data for different types of clients and audiences. Presentation techniques, language use for different audiences, and visualization tools techniques are included.  

This course introduces visualizations in R, Python, PowerBI or Tableau (students could use a different tool besides PowerBI/Tableau if desired).  This course is organized in 2 week blocks, with the following being due every 2 weeks: discussion board post, responses, exercises, and a project milestone.  Students complete 5 milestones for a project they work on the entire course. 
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 630 

### DSC 650 Big Data 

This course covers the fundamentals of data infrastructure and how technologies fit together to form a process, or pipeline, to refine data into usable datasets. This course focuses on building a predictive modeling pipeline used by the various types of projects that are called, “big data.”  

This course uses Spark, Databricks and other new technologies.  Each week students have a discussion board post, responses, and an exercise due. 
Prerequisite: Recommend DSC 540 

### DSC 680 Applied Data Science 

In the final course of the Data Science program, students will conduct several data science projects from origin to presentation. Students will gather data, then prepare, clean, analyze, and present their analysis to an audience.  

This course focuses on creation of the student’s portfolio (via GitHub or an alternate portfolio tool), providing peer reviews to peers, and completing 3 end to end projects with a presentation at the end.   
Prerequisite: Completion of all other required DSC courses
